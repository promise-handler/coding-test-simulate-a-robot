# Coding Test - Simulate a robot ðŸ¤–

## Solution

I've created a constant dictionary for directions, to be sure, that `L` and `R` will refer to correct directions. First I split the command and then iterate through the movement commands.

Please, be understanding. I spent less time on this task because previous one took me a bit more ðŸ˜„

## How to run it

1. Open the project folder and run command yarn or npm install to install all dependencies.
2. Run `execute` script with one string parameter e.g. `yarn execute "4 4 NORTH LLAA"`.

## If I had continued to work on it

1. I would hermetize, separate logic
2. Structure directories
3. Add logic tests
